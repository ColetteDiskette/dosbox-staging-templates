# ColetteDiskette's DOSBox Staging Config Templates
These templates are derived from DBGL's DOSBox templates, but with the relevant settings applied to the default DOSBox Staging config.

## Why did you go to this effort?
I've always liked the templates DBGL gives you to work with, but I moved away from DBGL itself since it's not made to use with DOSBox Staging. I keep these in my `~/Templates` directory to easily create configs for various games using Thunar's context menu.

## Note:
- These configs default to a windowed experience at 3x scale with aspect correction, so change that in your own copies if you wish.
- These all use the `pixellate` shader found in the `interpolation` directory at https://github.com/tyrells/dosbox-svn-shaders, so change that in your own copies if you wish. I use this shader so that I don't get uneven pixels and to avoid the shimmering effect such uneven pixels can cause during moments of horizontal scroll.
- I will more properly flesh out this readme later.
